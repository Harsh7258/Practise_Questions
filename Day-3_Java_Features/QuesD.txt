Question 4: What is a Stream in Java?
A Stream is a way to process data from a collection in a sequence of operations.
$ It does not store data
$ It works on data from a source (List, Set, Array, etc.)
$ It is mainly used for filtering, mapping, and aggregating data

1. How is it different from a collection?
Collections store data, Streams process data.
Collections focuses on data stroing but Streams focuses on processing the data that is stored in data source like List, set, array, etc.

2. Explain the difference between intermediate and terminal operations.
Intermediate Operations - 
$ Return a Stream
$ Do not execute immediately
$ Can be chained
$ numbers.stream().filter((n) -> n > 2).map((n) -> n * 2); // nothing runs yet
$ Examples: filter(), map(), sorted(), distinct() 

Terminal Operations - 
$ Return a result or void
$ Trigger execution of the stream
$ End the stream pipeline
$ numbers.stream().filter((n) -> n > 2).map((n) -> n * 2).forEach(System.out::println); // prints the numbers filtered and mapped
$ Examples: forEach(), collect(), reduce(), count()

3. Why are streams considered lazy?
Streams do nothing until a terminal operation is called, thats way it is considered lazy.
$ Better performance
$ Processes only required elements
