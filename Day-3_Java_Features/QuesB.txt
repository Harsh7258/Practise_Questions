Question 2: Java introduced records to simplify data-carrying classes.

1 What problems do records solve compared to traditional POJOs?
Traditional POJOs class needed too much boilder plate code of generating -
$ Fields, Constructor, Getters, equals(), hashCode(), toString()

Records automatically generate:
1. Constructor
2. Getters (called accessors)
3. equals(), hashCode()
4. toString()

$ Records are useful in API response, DTOs, Configuration data, and they are also immutable by default, POJOs are mutable 

usage: 
public record User(int id, String name) {} 

2. When would you not use a record?
Records are not for everything -
$ Records are meant for data, not behavior-heavy objects
$ If values must change      -  use a normal class.
$ If inheritance is required -  use class.
$ If only some fields define identity - avoid records (All fields are part of equality)
