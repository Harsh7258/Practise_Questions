Question 1: You need to store a list of customer IDs where:
        -   Order of insertion must be preserved
        -   Duplicate IDs are allowed

1. Which Java collection would you use and why?
To store the list of customer IDs we can use List Inteface of collection framework. 
$ An ArrayList is the standard implementation of the List interface, and it internally uses dynamic array to increase its size while maitaining the order and will allowed to store duplicates.

2. What would change if duplicates were not allowed?
If the requirement changes so that every customer ID must be unique, you should switch from a List to a LinkedHashSet.
$ using Set interface of collection framework: Used to eliminate duplicate entries at the time of display.
$ LinkedHashSet: maintain the insertion order and store value based on their hashcode so no duplication is alloweds
