Question 3: When an ArrayList is created with capacity 25, its internal array can hold 25 elements.
When an ArrayList is created with capacity 25, its internal array can hold 25 elements. Adding the 26th element exceeds the current capacity.
$ ArrayList resizes by creating a new, larger array.
$ Internally used new capacity formula: newCapacity = oldCapacity + (oldCapacity / 2)
$ New capacity = 25 + (25 / 2) = 37, so new capacity or new size of the list will be of size = 37
