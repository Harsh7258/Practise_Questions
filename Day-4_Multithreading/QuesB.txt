Question 2: You submit a task using ExecutorService.submit().

1. What does the submit() method return?
submit() method returns a future object, Future is like a promise -it represents the result of a task that will finish in the future.
$ Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);

2. How do you retrieve the result of the task?
Just by calling the .get() method, Future.get() - get() returns the actual result
$ It gives the value returned by call() method
$ If the task is Runnable, get() returns null
$ If the task is Callable, get() returns a value
Ex - Integer result = future.get();

3. What happens if Future.get() is called before the task is complete?
The calling thread waits (blocks), the thread pauses, then it waits until the task finishes, After the completion - the result is returned
 
System.out.println("Waiting...");
Integer result = future.get(); // waits here
System.out.println("Result: " + result); //This is called blocking behavior
