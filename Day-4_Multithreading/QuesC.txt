Question 3: Why is synchronization required in multi-threaded programs?
Because multiple threads may access the same data at the same time thats when we need synchronization in multi threading.
$ Use synchronization so only one thread accesses shared data at a time

1. Explain the purpose of wait() and notify(). Show via an example
Used for communication between threads 
$ wait() - thread goes to sleep and releases the lock
$ notify() - wakes up one waiting thread
$ notifyAll() - wakes up all waiting threads

2. Why must they be called inside a synchronized block?
Because as they work on object locks 
$ wait() releases the lock
$ notify() does not release the lock immediately
