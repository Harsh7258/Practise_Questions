Question 5: What is a deadlock in Java?
Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are locked forever, because each thread is waiting for a lock held by another thread.
$ No thread can continue, Program hangs

1. Explain a real-world scenario where a deadlock can occur. Can you show a piece of
code where a deadlock can potentially occur.
Two people and there are two resources
$ Person A has Pen and wants Paper
$ Person B has Paper and wants Pen
$ Both wait forever - Deadlock

2. Mention one way to prevent deadlocks in applications.
One way is to always acquire locks in the same order 
Other ones - 
$ Avoid nested locks
$ Use tryLock() (from ReentrantLock)
$ Minimize synchronized blocks
