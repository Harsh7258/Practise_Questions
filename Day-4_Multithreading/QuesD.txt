Question 4: Why are collections like ArrayList and HashMap not thread-safe?
ArrayList and HashMap are not thread safe as they dont use synchronization internally, multiple threads can modify them at the same time which causes data inconsistency, wrong values.
$ They are not thread-safe for performance reasons - (Synchronization slows down single-threaded programs)

1. Name one thread-safe collection.
Thread safe collection - ConcurrentHashMap 

2. When would you prefer ConcurrentHashMap over Collections.synchronizedMap()?
Both are similar but with different core functionality
$ Collections.synchronizedMap() - Map<Integer, String> map =
    Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
1. uses one lock for the entire map 
2. only one thread can access it at a time

$ ConcurrentHashMap - Map<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
1. Uses multiple locks internally
2. Multiple threads can read/write at the same time, much faster and scalable

$ ConcurrentHashMap is preferred over Collections.synchronizedMap() for High concurrency, Many read/write operations, Multi-threaded real-world applications (web apps, microservices)
