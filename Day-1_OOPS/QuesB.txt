Question 2: A withdrawal fails due to insufficient balance.

1. Would you use a checked or unchecked exception?
Use a checked exception (public class InsufficientBalanceException extends Exception) custom exception this will help in transaction process as it gives FAILED status to Transaction not crash the backend.
public class InsufficientBalanceException extends RuntimeException {
    public InsufficientBalanceException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

2. Why is exception handling critical? 
It prevents the backend from crashing when something goes wrong. In banking, it ensures that if an error occurs mid-transaction, the system stops safely without losing data or accidentally moving money and also saves the transaction process with FAILED status.

3. How would a custom exception improve code clarity?
Using a name like InsufficientBalanceException instead of a generic Error makes the code more clear to understand by team also. A developer reading the code immediately knows exactly what went wrong without taking much time through logs and saves time in debugging while testing.
