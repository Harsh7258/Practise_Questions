Questions 4: What is polymorphism in Java?

Polymorphism means one method, many forms, that can be achieved using method overriding.
$ same method, different behaviour

1. Explain compile-time vs runtime polymorphism.
$ Method overloading (compile time polymorphism) - same method name different parameters in same class 
Complier decides which method to call

$ Method overriding (run time polymorphism) - A child class gives its own version of a parent's method by @Override annotation (Overriding) the method and giving it own implementation.

2. Which one is achieved using method overriding?
Run time overriding - Runtime polymorphism is achieved using method overriding.
In shape example - Overriding: Each child class provides its own specific version of the draw() method and using @Override for own implementation of draw()

3. Why is runtime polymorphism important in real applications?
Runtime polymorphism is important because it lets a program decide which method to run at execution time, making code flexible, reusable, and easy to maintain.

$ One interface, many behaviors
$ New features can be added without changing existing code
$ Makes programs scalable and easier to update
